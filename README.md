librope
=======

This is a little C library for heavyweight utf-8 strings (rope). Unlike regular C strings, ropes can do substring insertion and deletion in O(log n) time.

librope is implemented using skip lists, which have the same big-O time complexity as trees but don't require rebalancing.

librope is _fast_. It will happily perform ~1-5 million edit operations per second, depending on the size of your strings. Inserts and deletes in librope outperform straight C strings for any document longer than a few hundred bytes.

This library is still pretty new. Let me know if you find any issues!

Usage
-----

Just add `rope.c` and `rope.h` to your project.

```c
// Make a new empty rope
rope *r = rope_new();

// Put some content in it (at position 0)
rope_insert(r, 0, "Hi there!");

// Delete 6 characters at position 2
rope_delete(r, 2, 6);

// Get the whole string back out of the rope
uint8_t *str = rope_createcstr(r, NULL);

// str now contains "Hi!"!
```

Wide Character String Compatibility
-----------------------------------

String insertion / deletion positions in Javascript, Objective-C (NSString), Java, C# and others are **wrong sometimes**!!!

These languages store strings as `wchar` arrays (arrays of two byte characters). Some characters in the unicode character set require more than two bytes. These languages encode such characters using multiple wchars as per UTF-16. This works most of the time. However, insertion and deletion positions in these strings still refer to offsets in the underlying array. So unicode characters which take up 4 bytes in UTF-16 count as two characters for the purpose of deletion ranges, insertion positions and string length.

Even though these characters are exceptionally rare, I don't want my editor to go all funky if people start getting creative. About a quarter of librope's code is dedicated to fixing this mismatch. However, bookkeeping isn't free - librope performance drops by 35% when wchar conversion support is enabled.

For more information, read my [blog post about it](http://josephg.com/string-length-lies).

Long story short, if you need to interoperate with strings from any of these dodgy languages, here's what you do:

- Compile with `-DROPE_WCHAR=1`. This macro enables the expensive wchar bookkeeping.
- Use the alternate insert & delete functions `rope_insert_at_wchar(...)` and `rope_del_at_wchar(...)`. Take a look at the header file for details.

#### Beware:

- When using `rope_insert_at_wchar` you still need to convert the string you're inserting into UTF-8 before you pass it into librope.
- The API lets you try to delete or insert halfway through a large character. You probably don't want to do that.
- librope is 100% faithful when it comes to the characters you're inserting. If your string has byte order marks, you might want to remove them before passing the string into librope.
